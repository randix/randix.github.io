<h2>Pocket Computer</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
The name "smartphone" is a misnomer. It should be called
a "pocket computer".
This is a little about how I use my phone, a veritable
pocket computer.
<p/>
Here is a list of my primary apps:

<h3>Communication</h3>
Messenger
Facetime
Phone

<h3>Documents and Files</h3>
The Files app allows access to iCloud files, Dropbox files,
Box files, and most other cloud storage providers (Microsoft,
Google, many others) and some apps' local files on
the iPhone.  I use GoodReader as a place to keep all of my
documents, as a "file system".  You can easily set up
Goodreader to synchronize with a computer or almost any
cloud storage, such as Dropbox or Box, or a private
server. The one exception is iCloud - of course, Gooodreader For an example of how I use various services
together, browse to http://randix.net to see how I use
Dropbox.  All of those pictures are stored on Dropbox.

<h4>Dropbox versus iCloud</h4>

<h4>Backups</h4>
I use iCloud, Dropbox and Box. You can install them on your
computer, they are auto-synchronizing methods, keeping
everything in the cloud and on your computer. They don't
keep all documents on your iPhone by default, but can be
told to keep individual files locally.
<p/>
Goodreader

<h4>Scanning Documents and Receipts</h4>
I scan documents with Jotnot Pro. It lets you snap a photo
and convert it to a compact, rectified PDF, with color,
black and white, and contrast simply adjustable. Then I
“export” the document to GoodReader, and move it to a happy
location in my document hierarchy. Later when I sync
GoodReader, the document is on stored my computer as well.

<h3>Calendar, Reminders, Notes, and Clock</h3>
I use the standard app Reminders for various lists,
particularly a grocery list. I share that with my daughter,
so anything missing out of the kitchen gets added, by her or
by me when discovered, and the next one to go to the grocery
store buys everything on the list.

<h3>Books</h3>
I have four book reading apps: BLB (Blue letter Bible),
Bible, Kindle and iBooks. I like the Bible app for it’s
yearly bible reading plans.

<h3>Spreadsheets and Document Creation</h3>
I use Numbers for my spreadsheets, especially two files,
both of which I keep encrypted, and they live primarily in
iCloud, and available immediately on all of my devices:
Secure.numbers, in which I keep all of my passwords, and
Fin2017.numbers, which is all of my financial bookkeeping.
I can unlock these two files with my fingerprint. I have
tried many password storage methods, and cannot find
anything more convenient than just doing it myself.
<p/>
I also keep Pages on my iPhone, but don't use it much there.
As I mentioned, I have the Apple wireless keyboard,
so I can write and edit formatted documents there. I avoid
formatted documents as much as life allows, and prefer plain
text documents. For that I prefer Textastic, which manages
documents and allows me to move them around nicely.  And
remember, final storage is always in GoodReader, be it text
documents, PDF, Numbers or Pages documents. I presume you
already know that Numbers handles Excel documents (I think)
better than Excel itself, and Pages handles Word documents
(I also think) better than Word itself. And I use PDF Expert
for editing and generally manipulating PDF files, in
particular signing and then sending back. The phone is a
little small for doing much of that there, but I can, when
in a hurry.

<h3>Camera and Photos</h4>

<h3>Maps and Navigation</h3>
There are many "offline" navigation apps, for finding your
way around when you don't have internet connectivity.
CoPilot is the one I use, but that is simply a matter of
taste and history.

<h3>Other Apps</h3>
I also use the standard apps a lot: Calendar, Mail,
Messages, Contacts, Maps, Clock, Camera, Photos, Notes, and
Weather.  A mainframe computer in my pocket!
<p/>
These apps each cost a small amount, all under $10:
<ul>
	<li>GoodReader</li>
	<li>JotNot Pro</li>
	<li>Textastic</li>
	<li>PDF Expert</li>
</ul>
