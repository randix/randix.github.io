<h3> RedSide App Coming Soon to the Apple AppStore!</h3>

<h4>What is RedSide?</h3>

<p/>
RedSide is the <em>secure</em> Cloud storage app.

<p/>
Data transmitted across networks that <em>you</em> don't control,
or stored on devices or in the Cloud on systems not under <em>your</em>
control can be assumed to be insecure.  Most Cloud Storage providers
offer "secure" storage, but the data is not encrypted until it is
already in the Cloud.  This means that such providers <em>can</em>
decrypt the data, because they hold the encryption keys.  Or the
data is <em>only</em> secured during transportation. This has been
demonstrated repeatedly in the recent past to offer security that
is often easily breakable and susceptible to serious software
security bugs.

<p/>
If you want secure data, it must be encrypted on devices under your
immediate control and using keys to which only you have access. Anything
less is only <em>apparent</em> security.

<h4>What does the name RedSide mean?</h3>

<p/>
The name <em>RedSide</em> is taken from communications technology
in which data that is transmitted across insecure networks or stored
in insecure storage is encrypted. The data is only available in
unencrypted form on the <em>red side</em> of such devices.

<h4>How does the RedSide App work?</h3>

<p/>
RedSide offers data storage on your iPad and / or iPhone. There is
a version available for OS&nbsp;X.

<ul>
<li>
Upload data to and download data from remote server storage.
</li>

<li>
Synchronize unencrypted data with remote server storage. This is
primarily intended to synchronize your data with your local computer,
which is fully under your control. (It is not recommended to
synchronize unencrypted data with Cloud Storage.)
</li>

<li>
Synchronize <em>encrypted</em> data with remote server storage. The
data is anonomized, compressed and encrypted on your local device
before transmitting to the Cloud storage.
</li>

<li>
Synchronize multiple devices (iPads and iPhones) using the encrypted
Cloud storage.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Which Cloud Servers does RedSide support?</h3>

<p/>
RedSide Version 1.0.0 supports Dropbox&copy; and SFTP (OS&nbsp;X, Linux, and
UNIX servers.)
