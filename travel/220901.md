#### 31 August 2022

I finalized the packing and loading. There is no room left in the trailer, and it is *really* not ready to go. Oh, well, the rest will have to be done on the road.

We went out to dinner after work, and had a great meal at Masala Bites in Dallas.

Finally, around 8:30 I started out, driving north. It was too late to go far, so I pulled into a rest area on I5 near Wilsonville and slept among the truckers.

I departed around 5:30 AM and arrived to my son's place in Beaverton for breakfast. It is nice to see his family with the grandkids. High speed internet! 

Daily goal: Yakima, WA for overnight, and then to Leavenworth, WA for the next work stop.
