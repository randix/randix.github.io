<h4>To Billings</h4>
<h4>5 September 2022 - Labor Day</h4>

<p/>
Waking up in De Borgia, I made a coffee and had my first breakfast
in the trailer.  After a leisurely breakfast and checking the vehicle
and trailer, I departed for, first Bozeman, and then Billings. I
crossed the Continental Divide in the early afternoon and am now
on the path used by Lewis & Clark.

<p/>
In Billings, I stayed near some friends who recently moved from
West Salem to Billings.

<p/>
I drove Miles City, and worked there for the day.

After work, I drove into North Dakota and stayed at Williston.
