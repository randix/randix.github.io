<h3>31 August 2022 - From Home</h3>

<p/>
I finalized the packing and loading.  There is no room left in the
trailer, and it is really not ready to go.  Oh, well, the rest will
have to be done on the road.

<p/>
We went out to dinner after work, and had a great meal at Masala
Bites in Dallas.

<p/>
Finally, around 8:30 I started out, driving north.  It was too late
to go far, so I pulled into a rest area on I5 near Wilsonville and
slept among the truckers.


<h3>1 September 2022 - To Beaverton</h3>

<p/>
I departed around 5:30 AM and arrived to my son’s place in Beaverton
for breakfast.  It is nice to see his family with the grandkids.
High speed internet to work for the day!

<p/>
Today’s goal: Yakima, WA for overnight, and then to Leavenworth,
WA for the next work stop.


<h3>2 September 2022 - Washington: Yakima and Leavenworth</h3>

<p/>
Yakima is pretty. No pictures. I arrived, slept and drove on.

<p/>
Leavenworth is a city styled as a Bavarian, Germany village.  I was
impressed with the authenticity in the building architecture, outside
and inside.  This is a beautiful town for a foot tour, the smells
and sights of authentic Bavarian food brought back a lot of memories.

<p/>
After the "Stadtbesichtigung" I headed out towards the east on Highway 2.
The overnight was in Wilbur, WA.

<h3>3 September 2022 - Otis Orchards</h3>

<p/>
I had arranged to meet friends at 10:00 in Spokane, so got an early start.
The sunrise was impressive, with the haze from the smoke of a forest fire and clouds.

<p/>
The wheat fields seem endless.

<p/>
After a stop at Walmart and then a shower at the gym, we met at church,
visited, had lunch and then went to visit more friends!
