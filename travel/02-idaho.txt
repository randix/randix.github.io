<h3>4 September 2022 - Coeur d'Alene</h3>

<p/>
This morning presented an opportunity to oreganize the camp trailer.
Now I can just go in and go to bed, get up, cook, and carry on.

<p/>
Coeur d'Alene is one of America's prettier cities, in my opinion.
I spent the rest of the morning getting some breakfast, and taking
a foot tour of the downtown area.

<p/>
Coeur d'Alene is famous for it's Hudson's Hamburgers, the beach,
the hotel on the water with a boardwalk, and Tubb's Hill. You can
hike around the hill in about 45 minutes, with views of the mountains
and lakes.

<p/>
The boardwalk behind the hotel.

After I'd seen enough of Coeur d'Alene, I drove east and stayed
just over the Montana boarder in a little place called De Borgia,
MT.
