#### Preparations

I bought a 5' x 8' cargo trailer. It has a window on the left side and a standard RV-style door on the right side. A standard cargo trailer door has the risk of someone on the outside locking the door such that anyone inside could not easily get out.

Conversion to a camper trailer, the following modifications have been made:
- standard twin size bed with sheets and blankets
- emergency cold weather sleeping bag
- nightstand shelf
- portapotty / composting toilet
- work table
- a storage shelf
- diesel heater
- storage box on the trailer tongue
  - diesel tank
  - battery
- 12V to 120V inverter
- fuse box
- USB/A and USB/C outlets
- battery voltage monitor
- for light, standard 3 D-cell camping LED lights
- butane camping cook stove
- 12 quart camping ice-box
- cooking and eating utensils 
- 7 gallon water tank
- gray water storage tank
- clothes and jackets
- storage for clothes under bed

Jeep supplies:
- all of the tools used during the camper conversion
- off-road recovery stuff
- 2000 watt generator
- camping chairs
- extension cord
