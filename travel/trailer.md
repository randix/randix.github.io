##### Camp Trailer

I bought a 5' x 8' cargo trailer. It has a window on the left side and a standard RV-style door on the right side. A standard cargo trailer door has the risk of someone on the outside locking the door such that anyone inside could not easily get out.

- storage box on the trailer tongue
  - diesel tank
  - battery
- electrical
  - 12V to 120V inverter
  - fuse box
  - diesel heater
  - USB/A and USB/C outlets
  - battery voltage monitor

  - work table
  - storage shelf
- standard twin size bed with bedding
- emergency cold weather sleeping bag
- nightstand shelf
- portapotty / composting toilet
- for light, standard 3 D-cell camping LED lights
- butane camping cook stove
- 12 quart camping ice-box
- cooking and eating utensils 
- 7 gallon water tank
- gray water storage tank
- clothes and jackets
